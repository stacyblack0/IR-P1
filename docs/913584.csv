913584,List of Cluedo characters,"List of Cluedo characters  This is a list of characters in the game of ""Cluedo"".  ""Dr. Black"" (UK)/""Mr. Boddy"" (US), a stock character and generic victim, is the owner of Tudor Close (later Tudor Manor and Tudor Hall). In ""Cluedo"" he is the unseen host who is murdered, which inspires the quest to discover who murdered him, with what implement, and where the crime occurred in his mansion. Dr. Black was listed in the original patent filing as one of the 10 characters created for the game, in which one character was drawn from the suspect cards to be the new victim before the start of a game. Although the victim and the player assignments were never intended to be the same, before the publication of the first edition Dr. Black became the permanent victim in the UK and Mr. Boddy in North America. Mr. Boddy's name is a pun on the fact that the character is a dead body.   Parker Bros. released the Clue VCR Mystery Game in 1985, introducing the first new Cluedo characters in 36 years. The characters also appeared in a number of spin-off games and licensed products:  In 1986, Super Cluedo Challenge and Super Sleuth were released in the UK, introducing the second wave of new board-game characters:  In 2009, Electronic Arts released an iOS version of Cluedo in which the player is a reporter.   Released in 2003, Clue FX is an electronic talking version with audio voices and clues. The victim in this version is Mr. Meadow-Brook. Other new characters are:   Several variants of the game have been developed for children, most notably Clue and Cluedo Jr., which usually involve the disappearance of something (or someone) rather than a murder. These variants generally use the standard six surnames with different first names (or titles), often changing the gender of the original character. Typical of the first name changes, the UK edition of Cluedo Jr. introduced the first animal players or suspects: Samantha Scarlett, Mustard the Dog, Wendy White, George Green, Polly Peacock, and Peter Plum.

In 1985, Cluedo began expanding its character roster and was the premise of a film:  In 1990, ""Cluedo"" inspired several television series which (in addition to the standard six characters) created additional characters – primarily victims.The most notable recurring character in the UK series was Mr. White, and the Australian series introduced Det.
