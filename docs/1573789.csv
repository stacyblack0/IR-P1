1573789,WSNV,"WSNV  WSNV (93.5 FM) is a hot adult contemporary formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Salem, Virginia, serving Metro Roanoke. WSNV is owned and operated by iHeartMedia.  WSNV launched on March 7, 1969 with the callsign WJLM and carried a Country format for 33 years, last branded as ""J93.5, Today's Hot Country"". Clear Channel purchased the station and at midnight on December 26, 2002, the format was flipped to Light Adult Contemporary, branded as ""Sunny 93.5"" and changed the callsign to WSNV.  Just after noon on March 10, 2005, WSNZ at 102.7 FM became a simulcast of WSNV and changed the branding to ""93.5 Roanoke, 102.7 Lynchburg; Sunny FM"". At noon on December 17, 2007, WSNZ swapped calls and formats with WJJX at 101.7 FM. In March 2011, it was announced that WSNV would no longer be permitted to carry the station on more than one frequency due to broadcast laws. Therefore, at approximately 5:00 P.M. on March 25, 2011, WSNZ split from its simulcast with WSNV and began simulcasting WSFF at 106.1 FM. In late 2012, WSNV shifted more towards a Classic Hits format, slightly changing the branding back to ""Sunny 93.5; Hits of the 60's, 70s and 80s"" as it did from December 26, 2002 to March 10, 2005. On August 25, 2014, the slogan changed to ""70's and 80's Hits"".  While the classic hits format was relatively successful, it did have quite a bit of overlap with sister station WSFF; combined with competition from rimshot simulcasters WHTU and WZZI, Sunny was not able to make more headway in the Roanoke market, and WSNV registered a 3.3 share in the Spring 2016 Nielsen Audio ratings, the last ratings book revealed during the format's run. As a result, following their Christmas music stint during the months of November and December, WSNV began stunting on December 27, 2016 with a ""Wheel of Formats"", running different format blocks that change with every few songs (such as classic country, smooth jazz, urban contemporary, and even all-Elvis) and asking listeners to vote for a new format on the website of sister station WJJS, with said new format debuting on January 3, 2017, at 10:00 A.M. At that time, after 10 hours of simulated construction sounds, the station flipped to Hot Adult Contemporary as ""Mix 93.5; Roanoke's Best Variety"". The first song on Mix was ""Shut Up and Dance"" by Walk the Moon."
