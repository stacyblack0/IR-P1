928613,South Plaza Island,"South Plaza Island  South Plaza (Spanish: ""Isla Plaza Sur"") is a small island off the east coast of Santa Cruz in the Galápagos Islands. It has an area of 0.13 km and a maximum altitude of 23 metres.  South Plaza was formed by lava up streaming from the bottom of the ocean. Despite its small size it is home to a large number of species and it is famous for its extraordinary flora. That is why this island is very popular with visitors. On the steep banks it is possible to see a great number of birds such as nesting red-billed tropicbirds and swallow-tailed gulls, but most of all, enjoying the beautiful view from atop the steep banks or strolling along the base of the cliff is an extremely pleasurable experience. Very attractive are the beautiful prickly pear cactus trees (""Opuntia echios"") and of course the large colony of Galápagos land iguanas. Depending on the season, the ""Sesuvium"" ground vegetation changes its colour from intense green in the rainy season to orange and purple in the dry season."
