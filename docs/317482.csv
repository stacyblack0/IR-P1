317482,Internalized oppression,"Internalized oppression  Internalized oppression is a concept in social justice which an oppressed group comes to use against itself the methods of the oppressor. Internalized oppression occurs when one group of people recognizes a distinct inequality of value compared to another group of people and, as a result, desires to be like the more highly valued group.  For example, sometimes members of marginalized groups hold an oppressive view toward their own group, or they start to affirm negative stereotypes of themselves. Internalized oppression may manifest on a group level as well as an individual one. Internalized oppression may result in conflict within the group, and discrimination among the group.  Internalized oppression may also exist among some immigrants and their descendants. If the host community devalues foreigner's ethnic origin, native language or culture, the person may feel a sense of inferiority. This could lead to self-hatred, which manifests itself through an exaggerated conformity with the dominant norms. In response to ridicule, an immigrant may attempt to compensate via assimilation and acculturation.  Multiple internal oppressions may occur when a person belongs to more than one oppressed group. For example, a woman of color might simultaneously be the victim of both internalized racism and internalized sexism. Another example would be a person of color who also is homosexual.  Causes  Effects  Internalized oppression may also occur in disabled persons. This phenomenon is called disability oppression. People with physical disabilities may distance themselves from others with disabilities to avoid association themselves with those who may be viewed by society as ""weak"" or ""lazy"".
