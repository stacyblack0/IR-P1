1543330,Lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite,"Lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite  Lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF), also called lanthanum strontium cobaltite ferrite is a specific ceramic oxide derived from lanthanum cobaltite of the ferrite group. It is a phase containing lanthanum(III) oxide, strontium oxide, cobalt oxide and iron oxide (cobalt iron oxide).  It is black in color and crystallizes in a distorted hexagonal perovskite structure. LSCF undergoes phase transformations at various temperatures depending on the composition. This material is a mixed ionic electronic conductor with comparatively high electronic conductivity (200+ S/cm) and good ionic conductivity (0.2 S/cm). It is typically non-stoichiometric and can be reduced further at high temperature in low oxygen partial pressures or in the presence of a reducing agent such as carbon.  LSCF is being investigated as a material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes and, potentially as a Direct carbon fuel cell anode.  LSCF is also investigated as a membrane material for separation of oxygen from air, for use in e.g. cleaner burning power plants.   It is commercially available."
