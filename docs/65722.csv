65722,Rubberband Girl,"Rubberband Girl  ""Rubberband Girl"" is a song by Kate Bush, and was the first of five singles to be released from ""The Red Shoes"" in 1993.  ""Rubberband Girl"" was released on 6 September 1993 and peaked at number 12 in the UK Singles Chart.  ""Rubberband Girl"" marked Bush's return from her third three-year hiatus. Not counting ""Rocket Man"" (her contribution to the Elton John tribute in 1991), this was her first UK release in 39 months. Three different versions of ""Rubberband Girl"" were released commercially: the LP and extended mixes shown here, and a disco version called the U.S. Mix which was released towards the end of 1994 on the ""And So Is Love"" single. Some claim that the U.S. stood for Utah Saints Mix and not United States the country, but the CD single cover notes credit this remix to American DJ Eric Kupper (a.k.a. Eric Kuppa).  The B-Side to the single was ""Big Stripey Lie"", in the U.K., and ""Show a Little Devotion"" in the U.S."
